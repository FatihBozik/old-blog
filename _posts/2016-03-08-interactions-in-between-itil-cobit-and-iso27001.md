## ITIL

**ITIL** is stand for **I**nformation **T**echnology **I**nfrastructure **L**ibrary. **ITIL** issued by OGC, is a set of framework for managing IT Service Level. Although **ITIL** is quite similar with **CobiT** in many ways, but the basic difference is **CobiT** set the standard by seeing the process based and risk, and in the other hand **ITIL** set the standard from basic IT service.

## COBIT

**CobiT** is stand for **C**ontrol **OB**jectives for **I**nformation and related **T**echnology. **CobiT** issued by ISACA (Information System Control Standard) a non profit organization for IT Governance. The **CobiT** main function is to help the company, mapping their IT process to ISACA best practices standard. **CobiT** usually choosen by the company who performing information system audit, whether related to financial audit or general IT audit.

## ISO27001

**ISO27001** is much more different between **CobiT** and **ITIL**, because **ISO27001** is a security standard, so it has smaller but deeper domain compare to **COBIT** and **ITIL**.

## What should be implemented first?

Thereâ€™s no exact answer about this question, its really depend on your company and your requirement. Most of company start to implemented **CobiT** first because its cover general information system. And after that they usually choose between **ITIL** or **ISO27001**.

Another consideration is about budget and authoritive. **CobiT** implementation usually run from internal audit budget and **ITIL** or **ISO27001** usually performed using IT departement budget. This consideration usually makes what kind of standard to implemented first become depend on management policy.

## What is the easiest standard?

From the implementatation view, **ITIL** is the easiest standard to be implemented. Because, **ITIL** could be implemented partially and still not have impact on performance. Example, if IT departement lack of budget and he could choose to implement IT Service Delivery layer only, and the next year he will try to implement IT Release Management or IT Problem Management.

However **COBIT** and **ISO27001** is quite difficult to be implemented partially, since it should see a process in bigger view first before they could implemented partially.
